A Power Hour is a popular drinking game in which participants take roughly a shot of beer every minute for an hour. Music plays in the background and the track changes every minute to alert the participants to take their drink. For those who wish to play such a game with no winners, PowerHour Pro helps out by providing the music and orchestrating your power hour using your Android device

## Features ##
* Mix up all your songs or use your existing playlists
* Skip unwanted songs without delaying the Power Hour
* Specify an offset to skip song intros
* Adjust power hour duration
* Auto-pause for phone calls
* Runs in the background so you can browse the web and message your friends while the music plays
* Android notifications show which song is playing in the notification area and let's you easily get back to the PowerHour Pro app

## History ##
I (Johnathan Gilday) wrote Power Hour Pro during my last year in college as a learning experience and in hopes for some extra pizza money. I no longer have the time required to keep the app up to date and compatible with the large number of Android devices coming to the market. I don't believe it's fair to continue charging for a product I cannot commit to; therefore, I'm opening the app up the community, for further development, under the Apache License. I'll still update it when I can.
